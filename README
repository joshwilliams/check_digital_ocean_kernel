check_digital_ocean_kernel

A small Nagios check that interfaces with the Digital Ocean API, and
reports whether a droplet's configured kernel matches the most recent
kernel in the series.

This is similar to a check for OS distribution package updates, but
since the kernel is set in a droplet's configuration this instead checks
that instead.
